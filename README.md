Notion CLI utility for generate pages using [notion api](https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro).

## What problem does this solve ?

Last year I started bullet journaling in notion. So if I want to plan something for a week or month then I need to
create pages with date name and set each date manually in the Date column. This was a repetitive and boring task for me
hence I create this CLI utility.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @burhanrashid52/notion-gen@0.0.2
```

## Commands

### Setup

First, use init command to setup your [notion secret token](https://developers.notion.com/docs#getting-started). It's
save token locally.

```bash
notion-gen init
```

### Generate Dates

```bash
notion-gen generate-dates <startDate> <endDate>
```

To generate dates we need to provide dates in `yyyy-mm-dd` format. After running this command it will ask for databaseid
and date column name.
